# flat_ALM_v1_AERODROME_dev
This project seeks to serve as a free, open source ALM system using web3.py, currently based solely for the liquidity provision platform Aerodrome. The "dev" status implies it is unfinished, but a "FULL" version will be placed in a separate repository once completed. 

Once completed, this project seeks to allow any user to:

1. Deposit, Withdraw, Stake, and Unstake crypto assets into Aerodrome Concentrated and Non-Concentrated Liquidity pools with ease.
2. Implement various management strategies of positions.
3. Understand some of the aspects of web3.py, as well as implementation of various forms of logic to solve data management related issues.
